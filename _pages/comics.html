	<h2 style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">La bien soutenable légèreté de l'être</h2>

	<p>
		My first comic book (in French), published by Jimmy Beaulieu in his collection colosse, where we follow Aida and Sam, two former colleagues, who find themselves in Prague, on a walk across the city. 
		Inspired by Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can find my comics at Planète BD in Montréal, or online <a href="https://jimmybeaulieu.bigcartel.com/product/la-bien-soutenable-legerete-de-l-etre-par-melisande-teng">here</a>

	<h2 style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">Living as Nature?</h2>

	<p> As part of the <a href="https://cocreating.art/">Co-Creating with Art and AI residency</a>, <a
			href="https://www.instagram.com/oyenhra/">Carling Sioui</a> and I
		drew comics
		exploring the theme of living as Nature from the perspectives of an Indigenous lansdscape architect and a
		researcher in AI for biodiversity conservation.
		Our reflection was guided by the following questions:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How do AI researchers in biodiversity conservation reconcile Western science with Indigenous knowledge and
			ways of knowing of “living as Nature”, when machine learning models often optimize for anthropocentric
			metrics
			that pertain to “living with” or “living from” Nature?</li>
		<li>How do Indigenous stewards of the land view AI tools when it comes to sharing traditions and
			intergenerational
			knowledge, and how could AI tools be useful in sharing those perspectives?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Here is a short video to introduce our project.
