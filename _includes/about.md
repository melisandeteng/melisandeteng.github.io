I am PhD student at [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/)/[Mila](https://mila.quebec/) working on applications of machine learning for biodiversity conservation and to tackle climate change under the supervision of Prof. [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/),Prof. [Hugo Larochelle](https://mila.quebec/en/person/hugo-larochelle/) and Prof. [David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/). 
My current research focuses on biodiversity monitoring using remote sensing data and citizen science data. I am particularly interested in species distribution modeling and forest monitoring.
With a wonderful [team](https://thisclimatedoesnotexist.com/about#team), I also worked on [ThisClimateDoesNotExist.com](https://thisclimatedoesnotexist.com/), a website to visualise the impacts of climate change in our own backyard.
I am also happy to be contributing to [Future Earth Canada](https://montreal.futureearth.org/)'s initiatives, including work on [Nature-based climate solutions](https://www.indigenousclimateaction.com/entries/new-nature-based-climate-solutions-report-sneak-peek) with [Indigenous Climate Action](https://www.indigenousclimateaction.com) and with the [Coalition for Digital Environmental Sustainability](https://www.sparkblue.org/CODES#:~:text=The%20Coalition%20for%20Digital%20Environmental,for%20sustainability%20and%20climate%20action.).

I earned a Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics, Computer Vision and Machine Learning ([MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)) from [Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en), and completed a double degree (MSc in Engineering and Applied Mathematics / MSc in Management and Social Entrepreneurship) at [Ecole Centrale Paris](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) and [ESSEC Business School](https://www.essec.edu/en/).

I was a 2018 [Data Science for Social Good fellow](https://www.dssgfellowship.org/) where I worked with the Croatian Institute of Public Health on proactive advising for vaccine outreach, and a 2019 [Voting Rights Data Institute fellow](https://sites.tufts.edu/vrdi/).
### Beyond research

I generally love learning new things and sharing what I have learned, and it is important to me to give back to the community! 
I was Teaching Fellow for the amazing initiative [Delta Analytics](http://www.deltanalytics.org/) and a mentor for [Technovation](https://technovationchallenge.org/).  At Mila, I am a member of the Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Committee and a member of the Sustainability Committee, and was a Lab Representative in 2021. 

I find a lot of joy in writing stories, mostly in the form of comics recently, if I'm not at the metalsmithing or pottery studio. 
I enjoy painting, hiking, playing the piano, reading and spending time with my friends, ...
I sing in the [Newman Chapel Choir](https://newmancentre.org/chapel-choir) and I played the bass drums in the [Princeton University Band](http://www.princetonuniversityband.com/) which was really fun (scrambling > marching).
